- **Passing Tests**: 6 (02, 08, 09, 12, 18, 19)
- **Failing Tests**: 13 (01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17)

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Validate Passing Tests
Run all variations of the 6 passing tests to understand why they work.
- [ ] Complete Test 02 variants (6 tests)
- [ ] Complete Test 08 variants (6 tests)
- [ ] Complete Test 09 variants (6 tests)
- [ ] Complete Test 12 variants (6 tests)
- [ ] Complete Test 18 variants (6 tests)
- [ ] Complete Test 19 variants (6 tests)

**Total**: 36 tests to run

### Phase 2: Analyze Replica Impact
Test -a variants of all failing tests to see if replicas are the issue.
- [ ] Test 01-a, 03-a, 04-a, 05-a, 06-a, 07-a, 10-a, 11-a, 13-a, 14-a, 15-a, 16-a, 17-a

**Total**: 13 tests to run

### Phase 3: Find Thresholds
Test light/heavy variants (-c, -e) of failing tests.
- [ ] Complete light variants (-c) for all 13 failing tests
- [ ] Complete heavy variants (-e) for all 13 failing tests

**Total**: 26 tests to run

### Phase 4: Full Matrix
Complete all remaining variants.
- [ ] All -b variants (all pods)
- [ ] All -d variants (extended/alternative)

**Total**: 26 tests to run

## Execution Guide

### Quick Start (Test Today)
Run passing test variations first - should all pass:
```bash
for test in 02-pod-kill-{a..e}.yaml; do
  echo "Running $test"
  kubectl apply -f tests/$test
  sleep 300
  kubectl delete -f tests/$test
  sleep 60
done
```

### Full Investigation (This Week)
Run all 114 tests systematically:
1. Phase 1: 36 tests (passing variants)
2. Phase 2: 13 tests (replica variants of failing)
3. Phase 3: 26 tests (light/heavy variants)
4. Phase 4: 26 tests (all/extended variants)
5. Remaining: 13 original failing tests

**Total Time**: ~57 hours (at 30 min per test + 5 min buffer)

## Documentation Files Created

1. **TEST-VARIATIONS-GUIDE.md** - Detailed reference for each variation
2. **VARIATIONS-SUMMARY.md** - Overview and expected usage patterns
3. **QUICK-REFERENCE-VARIATIONS.md** - Quick lookup and monitoring tips
4. **ANALYSIS-FRAMEWORK.md** - Systematic investigation approach
5. **This file** - Complete checklist of all tests

## Notes

- ✅ = Test category is passing
- ❌ = Test category is failing
- All tests preserve original namespace (`demo`) and cluster name (`pg-ha-cluster`)
- No existing tests were modified
- All variations use consistent naming convention
