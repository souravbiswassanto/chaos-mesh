### ⚠️ Tests Expected to Show Issues (13)
- Pod: `01`, `03`, `04` - Various pod failures
- Network: `05`, `06`, `07`, `10` - Network degradation
- System: `11`, `17` - Time drift, node failures
- I/O: `13`, `14`, `15`, `16` - Storage issues

## 🎯 Recommended Learning Path

### 🌱 Beginner (30 minutes)
1. Read `INDEX.md` for overview
2. Run `./run-tests.sh check`
3. Try `./run-tests.sh test 02-pod-kill.yaml`
4. Watch with `./run-tests.sh monitor`

### 🌿 Intermediate (2 hours)
1. Read `README.md` for full context
2. Run `./run-tests.sh pod` (all pod tests)
3. Review `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for commands
4. Document findings using `VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md`

### 🌳 Advanced (4+ hours)
1. Run `./run-tests.sh all` (complete suite)
2. Analyze failure patterns
3. Customize tests for your needs
4. Review `TEST-SUMMARY.md` for reporting

## ⚡ Quick Test Examples

### Example 1: Test Pod Failover (2 minutes)
```bash
# Apply test
kubectl apply -f 02-pod-kill.yaml

# Watch pods (in another terminal)
watch kubectl get pods -n demo

# See the failover happen (2-10 seconds!)
# Then cleanup
kubectl delete -f 02-pod-kill.yaml
```

### Example 2: Test Network Issues (5 minutes)
```bash
./run-tests.sh test 08-network-loss.yaml
# Observe how cluster handles 100% packet loss
```

### Example 3: Run All Tests (3-4 hours)
```bash
./run-tests.sh all
# Grab coffee, monitor progress, document results
```

## 🔍 What to Monitor

During any test, watch these:
1. **Pod Status**: `kubectl get pods -n demo -w`
2. **Pod Roles**: Which pod is primary vs standby
3. **Failover Time**: How fast does standby become primary?
4. **Data Integrity**: Is your data safe?
5. **Logs**: What's happening in pg-coordinator?

## 🎓 Understanding Test Results

### ✅ "Pass" Means:
- Cluster recovered automatically
- No data loss
- Failover happened (if expected)
- System returned to healthy state

### ❌ "Fail" Means:
- This test exposed a vulnerability
- You learned where improvements are needed
- Now you know system limits
- Great for capacity planning!

**Remember**: Even "failing" tests provide valuable insights! 💡

## 🚨 Important Safety Notes

### ⚠️ Before You Start
- [ ] This is NOT production (right?)
- [ ] You have recent backups
- [ ] Team knows you're testing
- [ ] You have 3-4 hours for full suite
- [ ] Monitoring is ready

### 🛡️ If Something Goes Wrong
```bash
# Emergency cleanup
./run-tests.sh cleanup

# Check cluster
kubectl get postgres -n demo
kubectl get pods -n demo

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n kubedb -l app.kubernetes.io/name=kubedb-ops-manager

# Still stuck? Check QUICK-REFERENCE.md troubleshooting section
```
